# TicTacToe-Game

Can play against another person or against the AI

The creation of the AI:
1. Implemented the Minimax algorithm to determine the best possible move at the board's current state
  - Assumes the player will play the most optimum position 
  - Will always result in a tie or the AI winning
2. Implemented alpha-beta pruning to improve the game's performance
